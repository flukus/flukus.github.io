	<h1>Fluent Interfaces for C</h1>
</header>
<main>
<p>Warning: The following is an act of masochism more than anything, an experiment to see exactly what's possible and what isn't. Fluent interfaces provide questionable value at the best of times, this example be replicating an assert library where thy seem to be more of a solution looking for a problem.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>My goal was to create something that resembled <a href="http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/">AssertJ</a> I was actually quite happy with the result of the whole endeavour.</p>
<pre class="c"><code>#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored &quot;-Wint-conversion&quot;
void main(int argc, char** argv) {
    assertThat(&quot;foo&quot;).startsWith(&quot;f&quot;).equals(&quot;foo&quot;);
    assertThat(57).greaterThan(4).lessThan(100).equals(55);
}</code></pre>
<p>The only part I'm not really happy about is the #pragma, there were plenty of workarounds for this but I couldn't find anything that worked with a fluent interface. More on this later though.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>The implementation is where things take a turn for this worse. Let's look at what defines the public interface, first of all there's the structures, they're all just a collection of function pointers and the typed value:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>struct _stringContext {
    struct _stringContext (*equals)(const char*);
    struct _stringContext (*startsWith)(const char*);
    const char* value;
} stringContext;
typedef struct _stringContext StringContext;</code></pre>
<p>Next there's the state handling which is the biggest source of issues. Without a compiler managing an implicit this pointer it has to be handled manually, rather than changing the API to pass along the state explicitly it is stored in the static stringContext variable, creating several potential issues.</p>
<p>The actual assert functions are incredibly simple, they assume the context object is created (they can't be called before it is) and return it (or another context). Returning the context is what allows the methods to be chained.</p>
<pre class="c"><code>StringContext string_equals(const char* expected) {
    assert(!strcmp(stringContext.value, expected));
    return stringContext;
}</code></pre>
<p>The context themselves are created in the *_assertThat methods:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>StringContext string_assertThat(const char* value) {
    StringContext context = {
        .value = value,
        .equals = string_equals,
        .startsWith = string_startsWith
    };
    stringContext = context;
    return stringContext;
}</code></pre>
<p>And finally there's the last source of problems but what ties everything together, the assertThat _Generic macro:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>#define assertThat(x) _Generic((x), \
    int: int_assertThat(x), \
    char*: string_assertThat(x) \
)</code></pre>
<p>This is simple and handy, except for the big problem of generating a lot of warnings about implicit casts. GCC seems to opt for giving you every warning possible too, you'll get warnings about implicitly casting ints to char* and you'll get warnings about converting char* to ints. There are many solutions to handle this generally, like moving the pragma into the macro itself, but the do not work (as far as I could tell) within an expression, like a fluent interface. Despite other issues this was the one I felt makes the whole exercise impractical in real projects.</p>
<p>The compiler will do the right thing though.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<p>Apart from the warnings the state management opens up several possible error scenarios. In exploring these scenarios it became apparent that some of them were even issues in high level languages. The most obvious one is multi threading, this is probably the easiest though, slap thread local on there and hopefully be done with it.</p>
<p>Others fall more into the realm of API misuse, consider the following code:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>int otherFunc() {
    assertThat(42);
    return 57;
}

void main(int argc, char** argv) {
    assertThat(57).equals(otherFunc());
}</code></pre>
<p>From quickly looking at the code it seems like this should pass, but the assert in otherFunc has changed the state so equals is now checking if 57 == 42. With some fluent API's you could put these contexts on a stack and this scenario would work, but in this case there is no finalization step, so there is no logical place to pop the stack. The next case is similar but applies to other languages too:</p>
<pre class="c"><code>int otherFunc() {
    assertThat(42);
    return 57;
}

void main(int argc, char** argv) {
    IntContext contextA = assertThat(57);
    IntContext contextB = assertThat(42);
    contextA.equals(57);
}</code></pre>
<p>With a fluent API there is nothing stopping the calling code from holding on to the context. In this case they'll get the wrong result, but imagine if this code had side effects, like a registerConfigInContainer() method. Fluent interfaces can't prevent this kind of error, they aren't as safe as they often feel.</p>
<p>As is usually the case when you try to implement something in C and strip away all the classes, the interfaces and other abstractions found in higher level languages you can see what's going on underneath a lot more clearly. In this case it's remarkably simple, a fluent interface can be boiled down to little more than a series of structures containing function pointers. This is still somewhat enlightening though, if I ever found myself implementing one in a high level language again my solution will be much simpler and have a lot few interfaces.</p>
