<main>
<p>Creating a windows service in .net is simple. Dead simple. Creating one that's pleasant to work with is only slightly more complicated. We're talking a couple of dozen LOC in total, it's that simple.</p>
<p>This is why I've never been able to understand the love for <a href="http://topshelf-project.com/">Topshelf</a>. It adds another dependency to manage yet saves very little, if any, code.</p>
<p>So I figured I'd create a post to show just how easy it is.</p>
<h2 id="step-1---create-the-app">Step 1 - Create the App</h2>
<p>First thing to do is to create the logic the service needs. This town crier example is straight from Topshelf's <a href="http://docs.topshelf-project.com/en/latest/configuration/quickstart.html">show me the code</a> section:</p>
<pre class="cs"><code>public class TownCrier {
    readonly Timer _timer;
    public TownCrier() {
        _timer = new Timer(1000) { AutoReset = true };
        _timer.Elapsed += (sender, eventArgs) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(&quot;It is {0} and all is well&quot;, DateTime.Now);
    }
    public void Start() { _timer.Start(); }
    public void Stop() { _timer.Stop(); }
}</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to run it, this can be done withe a standard console app:</p>
<pre class="cs"><code>class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        var crier = new TownCrier();
        crier.Start();
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;press any key to quit&quot;);
        System.Console.Read();
        crier.Stop();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Nothing amazing yet.</p>
<h2 id="turn-it-into-a-service">Turn it into a Service</h2>
<p>Turning this into a service requires some extra communication with the OS. In .net this is handled by the ServiceBase class (you will need to add a reference to System.ServiceProcess).</p>
<p>To create our own service, we just create a sub class and add our own logic:</p>
<pre class="cs"><code>public class ServiceHost : ServiceBase {
    private readonly TownCrier TownCrier;

    public ServiceHost(TownCrier crier) {
        TownCrier = crier;
    }

    protected override void OnStart(string[] args) {
        TownCrier.Start();
    }

    protected override void OnStop() {
        TownCrier.Stop();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Then modify our main method to run the host:</p>
<pre class="cs"><code>static void Main(string[] args) {
    var crier = new TownCrier();
    System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.Run(new ServiceHost(crier));
}</code></pre>
<p>If you run this, you'll see an error dialog displayed. This is because services cannot be run from a normal application.</p>
<p>To handle this, we need to add a check to set what environment we're running in. This can be done with the System.Environment.UserInteractive property. If this is true, it means we are running the app as a user, false means it is running as a service.</p>
<p>The main method then becomes a combination of the previous versions:</p>
<pre class="cs"><code>static void Main(string[] args) {
    var crier = new TownCrier();
    if (System.Environment.UserInteractive) {
        crier.Start();
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;press any key to quit&quot;);
        System.Console.Read();
        crier.Stop();
    } else {
        System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.Run(new ServiceHost(crier));
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This way, when you run the app normally, or debug it, it behaves as a normal console app, but it can also now be run as a service. Let's create the service.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-service">Create a Service</h2>
<p>The sc tool is the one to use when dealing with windows services. It can be used to list create, start, stop and delete them.</p>
<p>To create and start the service, open up a command prompt (with admin privileges) and enter these commands:</p>
<pre><code>sc create TownCrier binpath= c:\path\to\bin\Debug\TownCrier.exe
sc start TownCrier</code></pre>
<p>You can verify it's running with this command:</p>
<pre><code>sc query TownCrier</code></pre>
<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>
